Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about data analytics, data visualization, Python, and investment. In this README, you'll find information about my interests, projects, and contributions related to these areas. Feel free to explore, collaborate, and provide feedback.
I am a dedicated data enthusiast with a strong focus on data analytics and visualization. My background includes experience in Python programming and a keen interest in the world of investment. I believe in leveraging data-driven insights to make informed decisions and solve real-world problems.

During my participation in the Applied Data Analytics course, I had the opportunity to analyze a dataset containing 173 different species of mushrooms. Each species had information about the cap and belonged to various families. The code used to handle the data can be divided into four main parts: Part 1 involved preparing the data, Part 2 focused on clustering, Part 3 involved conducting classification analysis, and Part 4 entailed performing regression analysis.

You can find my other projects in different branches of this profile.
